1. What is the structure of project?
   The structure of my project is organized within a root folder named 'Task.' Inside this folder, I have two main subfolders: 'script' and 'style.' The 'script' folder contains a JavaScript file named 'index.js,' which is responsible for handling the interactive and dynamic aspects of the application. The 'style' folder contains a CSS file named 'style.css,' responsible for defining the visual presentation and layout of the web pages. The root folder also includes the main entry point of the application, an HTML file named 'index.html,' which serves as the starting point for rendering the content and integrating the JavaScript and CSS files.

2. What technology is used and why?
   I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6) to build the entire application. The combination of these technologies allows for the creation of a robust and interactive web application with a well-defined structure, visually appealing design, and dynamic user experience.

   HTML:
   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is employed for structuring the content and layout of web pages. It provides the foundation for organizing text, images, links, and other elements on a webpage.

   CSS:
   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is utilized for styling and formatting the HTML elements, ensuring a visually appealing and consistent presentation across different devices and browsers.

   JavaScript:
   JavaScript, being a versatile scripting language, is crucial for adding interactivity and dynamic functionality to the application. It enables features such as form validation, interactive user interfaces, and asynchronous communication with servers.

   Additional libraries
   Google Font:
   Google Fonts is a widely used service that provides a variety of free, open-source fonts that can be easily integrated into web projects. By specifying the font family through Google Fonts, you ensure consistent and visually pleasing typography across different devices and browsers.

   Font Awesome:
   Font Awesome is a popular icon toolkit that allows you to easily integrate scalable vector icons into your web project, enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of the user interface.
